Distance-Vector (DV) Algorithm
==============================

At each node, x:

 1: Initialization:
 2:     for all destinations y in N:
 3:       Dx(y) = c(x,y) /* if y is not a neighbor then c(x,y)= âˆž */
 4:     for each neighbor w
 5:       Dw(y) = ? for all destinations y in N
 6:     for each neighbor w
 7:       send distance vector Dx = [Dx(y): y in N] to w
 8:
 9: Loop
10:     wait (until I see a link cost change to some neighbor w or
11:           until I receive a distance vector from some neighbor w)
12:
13:     for each y in N:
14:       Dx(y) = min_v{c(x,v)+Dv(y)}
15:
16: if Dx(y) changed for any destination y
17:     send distance vector Dx = [Dx(y): y in N] to all neighbor
18:
19: forever
