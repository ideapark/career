* The Lessons of Unix History

- The largest-scale pattern in the history of Unix is this: when and where Unix
  has adhered most closely to open-source practices, it has prospered. Attempts
  to proprietarize it have invariably resulted in stagnation and decline.

- In retrospect, this should probably have become obvious much sooner than it
  did. We lost ten years after 1984 learning our lesson, and it would probably
  serve us very ill to ever again forget it.

- Being smarter than anyone else about important but narrow issues of software
  design didn't prevent us from almost complete blind about the consequences of
  interactions between technology and economics that were happening right under
  our noses. Even the most perceptive and forward-looking thinkers in the Unix
  community were at best half-sighted. The lesson for the future is that
  over-committing to any one technology or bussiness model would be a mistake --
  and maintaining the adaptive flexibility of our software and the design
  tradition that goes with it is correspondingly imperative.

- Another lesson is this: Never bet against the cheap plastic solution, Or,
  equivalently, the low-end/high-valume hardware almost always ends up climbing
  the power curve and winning. The economist Clayton Christensen calls this
  disruptive technology and showed in The Innovator's Dilemma [Christensen] how
  this happened with disk drives, steam shovels, and motorcycles, and commodity
  Intel machines replaced workstations and servers. The open-source movement is
  winning by commoditizing software. To prosper, Unix needs to maintain the
  knack of co-opting the cheap plastic solution rather than trying to fight it.

- Finally, the old-school Unix community failed in its efforts to be
  "professional" by welcoming in all the command machinery of conventional
  corporate orgnization, finance, and marketing. We had to be rescued from our
  folly by a rebel alliance of obsessive geeks and creative misfits -- who then
  proceeded to show us that professionalism and dedication really meant what we
  had been doing before we succumbed to the mundane persuasions of "sound
  business practices".

- The application of these lessons with respect to software technologies other
  than Unix is left as an easy exercise for the reader.
